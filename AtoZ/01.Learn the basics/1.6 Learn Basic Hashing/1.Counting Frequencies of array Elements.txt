Q:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/frequency-of-array-elements-1587115620/0

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {2, 3, 2, 3, 5}
P = 5
Output:
0 2 2 0 1
Explanation: 
Counting frequencies of each array element
We have:
1 occurring 0 times.
2 occurring 2 times.
3 occurring 2 times.
4 occurring 0 times.
5 occurring 1 time.

class Solution {
    //Function to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N in the array.
    public static void frequencyCount(int arr[], int N, int P) {
        int[] ans = new int[N];
        
        for(int n : arr){
            if(n <= N){
                ans[n-1]++;
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            arr[i] = ans[i];
        }
    }
}
